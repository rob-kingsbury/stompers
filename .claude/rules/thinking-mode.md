# Deep Thinking Mode

**When thorough analysis helps with animation and scroll work.**

## When to Use

| Task | Why |
|------|-----|
| Complex ScrollTrigger timing/sequencing | Multiple triggers interact, order matters |
| Multi-section animation coordination | Pinning, scrub, and toggle triggers in proximity |
| Performance debugging (jank, repaints) | Need systematic profiling approach |
| Responsive animation breakpoints | Mobile vs desktop behavior diverges |
| Architecture decisions (new section patterns) | Long-term implications for scroll flow |
| Lenis + GSAP integration issues | Subtle timing conflicts |

## When NOT Needed

- Simple CSS tweaks (colors, spacing, typography)
- Content updates (text, images)
- Single-property animations (opacity fade, basic translate)
- Clear, straightforward tasks with obvious solutions

## Trigger Phrases

Use these to request deeper analysis:
- "Think deeply about this"
- "Give this some real thought"
- "I want thorough analysis"
- "Consider this carefully"

## Integration

For high-complexity animation work, pair deep thinking with the scroll-analyzer MCP to visually validate assumptions.
